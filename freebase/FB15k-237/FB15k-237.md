# FB15k-237
The FB15k dataset contains knowledge base relation triples and textual mentions of Freebase entity pairs. It has a total of 592,213 triplets with 14,951 entities and 1,345 relationships. FB15k-237 is a variant of the original dataset where inverse relations are removed, since it was found that a large number of test triplets could be obtained by inverting triplets in the training set. Different from the original FreeBase knowledge graph, the FB15k-237 is stored in `txt` format instead of `N-Triples RDF`. For example:
```text
/m/08966        /travel/travel_destination/climate./travel/travel_destination_monthly_climate/month     /m/05lf_
/m/01hww_       /music/performance_role/regular_performances./music/group_membership/group      /m/01q99h
/m/09v3jyg      /film/film/release_date_s./film/film_regional_release_date/film_release_region  /m/0f8l9c
```
The separator is a tab character; the head and tail are Freebase ids of entities, and the relation is a single or a two-hop relation from Freebase, where an intermediate complex value type entity has been collapsed out.

## Download
### Microsoft Dump
You can download the dump of FB15k-237 from [this data dump](hhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52312) provided by Microsoft. The dump size is about 84 MB, and decompressing it needs additional 250GB storage space. You can decompress it by:
```shell
tar -xf ./FB15k-237.tar.xz
```
#### Contains
* **Triples:** the files `train.txt`, `valid.txt`, and `test.text` contain the training, development, and test set knowledge base triples. 
* **Lexicalized Dependency Path:** It also contains textual mentions files indicating the `mids` of two Freebase entities, together with a fully lexicalized dependency path between the entities. You can refer to the `readme.txt` within for more details.

## Preprocessing
Since the FB15k-237 is stored in `txt` format, we should convert it into one of the rdf formats that can be processed by `rdflib`, such as `N-Triples RDF (*.nt)`. Here is an example to convert the original format of FB15k-237 to `nt` format:
```python
from rdflib import Graph, Namespace

g = Graph()
n = Namespace("http://freebase.com")

file_path = '<Your FB15k-237 Directory>'
f = open(file_path, 'r')
for triple in f:
    triple  = triple.strip()
    s, p, o = triple.split('\t')
    # align entities with original FreeBase
    s = '/' + s.lstrip('/').replace('/', '.')
    o = '/' + o.lstrip('/').replace('/', '.')
    g.add((n[s], n[p], n[o]))
f.close()

g.serialize(file_path.replace('.txt', '.nt'), format='nt', encoding='utf-8')
```

## Query Knowledge Graph in Python
After preprocessing the FB15k-237, now we can query in the knowledge within it via `SPARQL`. Since the FB15K-237 is far smaller than the original FreeBase knowledge graph, we can load and query the KG via `rdflib` library within Python. Here is an example to query FB15k-237 where is the `film_release_region` of `/m/09v3jyg`:
```python
from rdflib import Graph

g = Graph().parse('<Your FB15k-237 Directory>', format='nt')
s = '<http://freebase.com/m.0gvrws1>'

query = """
SELECT ?object
WHERE {
    %s <http://freebase.com/film/film/release_date_s./film/film_regional_release_date/film_release_region> ?object .
}
""" % (s)
for row in g.query(query):
    print(f"{s}'s film release region is {row.object}")
```

## Map Entity ID to Real Name
Since the entities in FB15k-237 are `mids`, such as `/m/08966`, that convey little information at a glance. However, there is no direct way to obtain the textual name as Google shut down the Freebase API. There are some typically alternative methods to obtain the true name of each entity.

### Method 1: Query in FreeBase
The original FreeBase contains the real name of each entity. You can load the FreeBase by `OpenLink Virtuoso` as we introduced in [this tutorial](../freebase/freebase.md) and then query the real name. For example, you can query the real name of `/m/08966` by:
```python
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

SPARQLPATH = "http://localhost:8890/sparql"

sparql = SPARQLWrapper(SPARQLPATH)

sparql_txt = """
    PREFIX ns: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/>
    SELECT DISTINCT ?tailEntity
    WHERE { 
        ?entity ns:type.object.name ?tailEntity .
        FILTER(?entity = ns:%s)
    }
"""
entity_id = '/m/08966'.lstrip('/').replace('/', '.')
sparql.setQuery(sparql_txt % (entity_id))
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)
results = sparql.query().convert()
print(results)
```
Then, it returns a dictionary including:
```python
'tailEntity': {'type': 'literal', 'xml:lang': 'en', 'value': 'Zürich'}
```
It indicates the real name of `/m/08966` is `Zürich`.

### Method 2: Using FreeBase-WikiData Mapping
Google provides a [dump](https://developers.google.com/freebase/#freebase-wikidata-mappings) of 2.1M entities stored in RDF format, which maps freebase entity ids to wikidata entities. 
In practice, you can load this KG by `OpenLink Virtuoso` as we introduced in [this tutorial](../freebase/freebase.md) or by `rdflib` since it far smaller than the original FreeBase. Taking `OpenLink Virtuoso` as an example, you can query the real name of `/m/08966` by:
```python
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

SPARQLPATH = "http://localhost:8890/sparql"

sparql = SPARQLWrapper(SPARQLPATH)

sparql_txt = """
    PREFIX ns: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/>
    SELECT DISTINCT ?tailEntity
    WHERE {
        ?entity <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs> ?tailEntity .
        FILTER(?entity = ns:%s)
    }
"""
entity_id = '/m/08966'.lstrip('/').replace('/', '.')
sparql.setQuery(sparql_txt % (entity_id, entity_i))
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)
results = sparql.query().convert()
print(results)
```
Then, it returns a dictionary including:
```python
'tailEntity': {'type': 'uri', 'value': 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q72'}
```
You can finally obtain the true name of `m.08966` by visiting the wikidata link, which is `Zürich`.

### Method 3: Third-Part Resources 
There are some third-part datasets, such as [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kdm-daiict/freebase-wikidata-mapping), providing maps from mid to real name. You can direct replace the `mid` with the corresponding real name.
>[!WARNING]Since these datasets were built by third part and I have not carefully checked their quality, there may be some quality issues.
